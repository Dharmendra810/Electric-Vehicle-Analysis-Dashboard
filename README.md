# 🧩 Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Electric Vehicle (EV)** market across the United States. The dataset includes details of **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**, enabling an in-depth study of EV adoption trends, manufacturer dominance, model performance, and eligibility for clean fuel incentives.

The project aims to deliver clear insights into the **growth, distribution, and efficiency** of electric vehicles while showcasing Power BI visualization and dashboard design capabilities.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Understand the overall EV landscape** — including both BEVs and PHEVs — to assess market size and growth.
2. **Analyze the average electric range** to gauge technological progress and efficiency.
3. **Compare BEV vs. PHEV share** to highlight consumer adoption trends.
4. **Identify top vehicle manufacturers and models** dominating the EV market.
5. **Evaluate regional EV adoption** across U.S. states.
6. **Examine CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility** to understand the impact of policy incentives.
